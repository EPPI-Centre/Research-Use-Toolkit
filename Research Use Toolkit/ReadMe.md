# This is a preliminary readme!


The code in this repo is all specific to a project called "_Decision-makers' Research Use Toolkit_", but we think it might end up including some re-useable code. 

The aim of this tiny little project is to support a simple, "client only" Questionnaire, which will:

- Contain a lot of "rich text" with figures, links, and perhaps "expandable" "read more..." or similar options.
- Allow to download a full report with all answers provided.
- Remember answers given (using localStorage, so on a per browser instance basis, but should remember things across sessions)
- Allow to upload previously saved answers given to the questions.
- Might span across multiple pages, or use collapsible elements to provide a wizard-like experience, we'll see!

Tech used is the simplest possible:

- HTML/CSS,
- JavaScript,
- JQuery

(Might add bootstrap, perhaps)
